# Encrypting a bucket with Key Protect
{: #tutorial-kp-encrypt-bucket}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="10m"}

While all data stored in Cloud Object Storage is automatically encrypted using randomly generated keys, some workloads require that the keys can be rotated, deleted, or otherwise controlled by a key management system (KMS) like Key Protect.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #kp-encrypt-bucket-prereqs}

Before you plan on using Key Protect with Cloud Object Storage buckets, you need:

- An [IBM Cloudâ„¢ Platform account](http://cloud.ibm.com/)
- An [instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage](/objectstorage/create)
- An [instance of Key Protect](key-protect/key-protect-about)

You will also need to ensure that a service instance is created by using the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog) and appropriate permissions are granted. This tutorial does not outline the step-by-step instructions to help you get started.  This information is found in section  [Server-Side Encryption with IBM Key Protect (SSE-KP)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-kp)
