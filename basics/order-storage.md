# Order storage

## Understanding IBM Cloud

Until recently, IBM offered Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service in two distinct environments: [Bluemix][1]{: new_window} and [SoftLayer][2]{: new_window}.  Now these distinctions are fading as all cloud services are united in a single robust IBM Cloud platform with direct access to compute resources (containers, 12 factor apps, VMs, VSIs, serverless, bare metal), storage (block, file, and object), data management (databases and analytics engines), networking (load balancers, firewalls, DNS), DevOps tools (logging, monitoring), blockchain, an IoT platform, Watson services, and more.

## Creating a new Bluemix account

Before ordering a new IBM COS storage instance, it is necessary to create a customer account first.

1. Go to [bluemix.net][6]{: new_window} and click on the **Create a Free Account** button.
2. Fill out the form, providing your email address, name, region, and phone number.  Choose a password.
3. Follow the link provided by the confirmation email, and follow the links to log in to Bluemix.
4. Before using Bluemix, you need to set up a basic development environment.  Choose a region based on your geographic location, and choose a name for your organization.  Don't worry about being perfect - you can change it or create new organizations later. Follow the **Create** link.
5. Now you need to name your first development space.  Again, this can be changed at any time.  After you've chosen a name, follow the **Create** link.
6. Follow the **I'm Ready** link to get started with Bluemix.
7. Next up is ordering a new object storage service instance!

## Creating a new storage instance

1. Login toÂ [https://console.bluemix.net/](https://console.bluemix.net/){: new_window}.
2. Navigate to the catalog, by clicking **Catalog** in the navigation bar.
3. Look for the **Cloud Object Storage** tile in the storage section and select it.
4. Give the service instance a name and choose either the lite or premium plan.
5. Click **Create** and you will be automatically redirected to your new service instance.
