# Activity Tracker events
{: #at-events}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} (COS).
{: shortdesc}

This feature is not supported in {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}. [Learn more.](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cos-satellite)
{: note}

The {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 
For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-getting-started).  

By default, COS events that report on global actions such as creation of a bucket are collected automatically. You can monitor global actions through the Activity Tracker instance that is located in the Frankfurt location.

In {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, you can also monitor management events and COS data events. 
* Collection of these events in your account is optional. 
* You must configure each bucket to enable management events, or management and data events. Notice that you cannot enable data events only for a bucket. 
* To monitor management events, you must configure a bucket and specify the Activity Tracker instance where those events will be collected and forwarded.
* To monitor data events, you must select the option **Track data events**. 
* Each action that a user performs on a COS resource has a unique ID that is included in the event in the `responseData.requestId` field.



You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions, and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.


## Management events
{: #at-actions-mngt}

Management events are classified in the following categories:
* Global events
* Resource configuration events
* Bucket events
* Object events

### Global events

## Viewing events
{: #at-ui}

You can view the Activity Tracker events that are associated with your {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance by using [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-getting-started).

You can only provision 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service per location. 

To view events, you must identify the location where events are collected and available for monitoring. Then, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance in that location. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-launch#launch_cloud_ui).

### Management events
{: #at-ui-mngt}

{{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} global events are forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is located in Frankfurt.

All other {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} management events are forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance that is associated with the bucket.

To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance in the location that is associated with the bucket.

### Data events
{: #at-ui-data}

{{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} data events are forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance that is associated with the bucket.

To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance in the location that is associated with the bucket.


## Analyzing events
{: #at-events-analyze}

### Identifying the COS instance ID that generates the event
{: #at-events-analyze-1}

In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can have 1 or more COS instances. 

To quickly identify the COS instance ID in your account that has generated an event, check the field `responseData.serviceInstanceId` that is set in the **responseData** field.

### Identifying the bucket location
{: #at-events-analyze-2}

To quickly identify the bucket location, check the field `responseData.bucketLocation` that is set in the **responseData** field.

### Getting the unique ID of a request
{: #at-events-analyze-3}

Each action that a user performs on a COS resource has a unique ID.

To get the unique ID of a request to a COS resource, check the field `responseData.requestId` that is set in the **responseData** field.

### Getting all events for a multipart upload operations
{: #at-events-analyze-4}

When you upload a large object by using *multipart upload operations*, each operation generates an event. In each event, the field `responseData.uploadId` is set to the same value.

To search for all events that are part of a multipart upload operation, you can search for a specific `responseData.uploadId` value. 

### Getting all events that are generated for a restore request
{: #at-events-analyze-5}

A request to restore an object from an archive generates multiple events in COS:
1. A read action of the source object. This action generates an event with action **cloud-object-storage.object-restore.read**. 
2. A create action of the object into a bucket. This action generates an event with action **cloud-object-storage.object-restore.create**.  

You can use the `responseData.requestId` field to identify the events that are generated when you restore an object.

### Getting all events that are generated for copying an object from one bucket to another
{: #at-events-analyze-6}

A request to copy an object from one bucket to a different one generates multiple events in COS:
1. A read action of the source object. This action generates an event with action **cloud-object-storage.object-copy.read**. 
2. A create action of the object into the new bucket. This action generates an event with action **cloud-object-storage.object-copy.create**.   

To collect and monitor all events that report on a copy action across buckets, consider configuring each bucket to collect and forward events to the same Activity Tracker instance in your account.
* If one bucket is not enabled to collect management and data events, you will not receive the event that reports any copy action on that bucket.
* If you configure different Activity Tracker instances for each bucket, you will have one event in 1 instance and the other event in a different instance.

You can use the `responseData.requestId` field to identify the events that are generated when you copy an object from one bucket to another.

### Getting the details of a firewall update
{: #at-events-analyze-7}

Updating a bucket's firewall will generate a `cloud-object-storage.resource-configuration.update` event.

To get the details of what was changed, check for fields `requestData.allowedIp`, `requestData.deniedIp`, and `requestData.allowedNetworkTypes` that appear in the **requestData** field.
