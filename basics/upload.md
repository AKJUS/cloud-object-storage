# Uploading data

After getting your buckets organized it's time to add some objects.  Depending on how you want to use your storage, there are different ways to get data into the system. A data scientist might have a small number of very large files that will be used for analytics, a systems administrator might need to keep database backups in sync with local files, and a developer could be writing software that needs to read and write millions of files. Each of these scenarios will likely want to use different methods for data ingest.

## Using the console

Typically, using the web-based console is not the most common way to use {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.  Objects are limited to 200MB in size and the file name and key will be identical.  Multiple objects can be uploaded at the same time, and if the browser allows for multiple threads each object will be uploaded using multiple parts in parallel. Support for larger object sizes and improved performance (depending on network factors) is provided via Aspera high-speed transfer.

### Using Aspera high-speed transfer
{: #high-speed-transfer}

Aspera high-speed transfer is only available for buckets created in [the `us-south` region](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics/endpoints.html) at this time.

Using Aspera high-speed transfer for browser-based uploads and downloads offers the following benefits:

Overcome the limitations of traditional FTP and HTTP transfers to improve data transfer performance under most conditions, especially on networks experiencing high latency and packet loss.

Transfer any type of data â€“ multi-media files, disk images, unstructured data

Transfers take place in the background instead of in the active browser window.

Transfers can be viewed, paused, or cancelled independently.

When uploading an object using the console, the dialog box will present the option of using Aspera high-speed transfer.  Instead of the typical HTTP `PUT`, this option uploads the object using the [FASP protocol](http://asperasoft.com/technology/transport/fasp/) from [IBM Aspera](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/high-speed-data-transfer). Click the **Download plug-in** link and you'll be prompted to install the Aspera Connect plug-in for your web browser.

The plug-in can be [installed from the Aspera website](http://downloads.asperasoft.com/connect2/) directly. For help troubleshooting issues with the Aspera Connect plug-in, [see the documentation](http://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/documentation/8).

Once the plug-in is installed you will have the option to set Aspera high-speed transfer as the default for any uploads to the target bucket that use the same browser. Simply check the box labeled Remember my browser preferences. Toggle switches are also available in the bucket configuration page under **"Transfer options".** These switches allow you to set the default transport for uploads and downloads.

## Using a compatible tool

Some users will want to use some sort of standalone utility to interact with their storage.  As the Cloud Object Storage API supports the most common set of S3 API operations, many S3-compatible tools can also connect to {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} using [HMAC credentials](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/hmac/credentials.html).

Some examples include file explorers like [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) or [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/), backup utilities like [Cloudberry](https://www.cloudberrylab.com/) and [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/), command line utilities like [s3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) or [Minio Client](https://github.com/minio/mc), and many others.

## Using the API

Most programmatic applications of object storage will use an SDK (such as [Java](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries/java.html), [node.js](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries/node.html), or [Python](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries/python.html)) or the [Cloud Object Storage API](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/api-reference/about-api.html). Typically objects will be uploaded in [multiple parts](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics/multipart.html), with part size and number of parts configured by a Transfer Manager class.
