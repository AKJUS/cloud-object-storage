# Use SQL Query

IBM Cloud SQL Query is a fully-managed service that lets you run SQL queries (that is, `SELECT` statements) to analyze, transform, or clean up rectangular data.
{:shortdesc}

You can use SQL Query to create `SELECT` statements only; actions such as `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` are not possible.
{:tip}

Input data is read from CSV, JSON, or Parquet files located in one or more IBM Cloud Object Storage instances.  Each query result is written to a CSV file in a Cloud Object Storage instance of your choice.

For more information on using SQL Query see the [SQL Query documentation](/docs/services/sql-query/sql-query.html) and [Analyzing Data with IBM Cloud SQL Query](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/analyzing-data-with-ibm-cloud-sql-query-bc53566a59f5?linkId=49971053).
