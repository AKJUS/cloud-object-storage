# Using `Postman`

Here's a basic `Postman` setup for the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} REST API. Additional detail can be found in the API reference for [buckets](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/api-reference/api-reference-buckets.html) or [objects](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/api-reference/api-reference-objects.html).

Using `Postman` assumes a certain amount of familiarity with object storage and the necessary information from a [service credential](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/service-credentials.html) or the [console](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/getting-started.html).  If any terms or variables are unfamiliar they can be found in the [glossary](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics/glossary.html).

**Note**: Personally Identifiable Information (PII): When creating buckets and/or adding objects, please ensure to not use any information that can identify any user (natural person) by name, location or any other means.

## REST API client overview

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style that provides a standard for computer systems to
interact with each other over the web, typically using standard HTTP URLs and verbs (GET, PUT, POST, etc.) which are supported by all major development languages and platforms. However, interacting with a REST API is not as simple as using a standard internet browser. Simple browsers do not allow any manipulation of the URL request.  This is where a REST API client comes in.

A REST API client provides a simple GUI-based application to interface with an existing REST API library. A good client makes it easy to test, develop, and document APIs by allowing users to quickly put together both simple and complex HTTP requests. Postman is an excellent REST API client that provides a complete API development environment that include built-in tools for design and mock, debug, test, documentation, monitor, and publish APIs. It also provides helpful features such as Collections and Workspaces that make collaboration a cinch.
