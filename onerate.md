# Serving media with a One Rate instance
{: #onerate-overview}

Workloads that involve high volumes of data egress, such as media servers, can benefit from using a One Rate Objct Storage service instance. 
{: shortdesc}

## What is One Rate?
{: #onerate-what}

One Rate instances are significantly more expensive when it comes to storage costs, but much less expensive when taking into account egress charges.  You should consider using a One Rate instance if:

1. Your are a storage reseller, and most of the data being stored in Object Storage is being read over the public endpoints.
2. Your storage is being used to read large files outside of IBM Cloud, such as in post-production film editing, satellite imagery, or music production.

You should not use a One Rate instance for backups, data analysis, or for small files like PNGs for websites.
