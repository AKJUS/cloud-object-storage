# Replicating data across buckets 
{: #replicating-cos-bucket}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="10m"} 

While all data stored in Cloud Object Storage is highly durable and highly available, it can be necessary for compliance or other reasons to replicate and sync data across multiple buckets. 
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #replicate-bucket-prereqs}

Before you get started, you need:

- An [IBM Cloudâ„¢ Platform account](http://cloud.ibm.com/)
- An [instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage](http://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloud-object-storage)

You will also need to ensure that a service instance is created by using the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog) and appropriate permissions are granted. 

## Create a bucket
{: #replicate-bucket-create}
{: step}

First we'll create the source bucket:


## Create a destination bucket
{: #replicate-bucket-create-2}
{: step}

## Configure replication on the source bucket
{: #replicate-bucket-select}
{: step}

tbd

## Verify that it works
{: #replicate-bucket-verify}
{: step}

tbd
