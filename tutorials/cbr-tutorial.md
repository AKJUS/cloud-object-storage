# Securing data using context-based restrictions
{: #cos-tutorial-cbr}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"} 
{: toc-completion-time="10m"} 

In this tutorial, you will establish [context-based restrictions](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-setting-a-firewall) that prevent any access to object storage data unless the request originates from a trusted network zone.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #cos-tutorial-cbr-prereqs}

Before you plan on using [context-based restrictions](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-setting-a-firewall) with Cloud Object Storage buckets, you need:

- An [IBM Cloudâ„¢ Platform account](http://cloud.ibm.com/)
- An [instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage](http://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloud-object-storage)
- A role of `Administrator` for context-based restrictions
- A bucket

## Navigate to the context-based restrictions console
{: #cos-tutorial-cbr-console}
{: step}

From the **Manage** menu, select **Context-based restrictions**.

![Navigate to CBR](images/cbr_1.png)

## Create a new rule
{: #cos-tutorial-cbr-new-rule}
{: step}

1. Click on **Rules**.
1. Choose a name for the rule. This will help keep things organized if you end up with a lot of different rules across all of your cloud services.
1. Click **Continue**.

## Scope the rule
{: #cos-tutorial-cbr-scope}
{: step}

Now you can choose the specific object storage resources to which you would like to apply the context-based restrictions. This can become as specific or generic as you wish - you could apply the rule to all object storage instances and buckets, a specific service instance, or even a specific bucket.  Additionally, you can choose which networks (public, private, or direct) you wish to be included. 

In this example, we will choose a service instance.

1. Select **IAM services**.
2. Choose **Cloud Object Storage** from the drop down menu.
3. Select the **Resources based on specific attributes** radio button.
4. Check the **Service instance** box.
5. Select the service instance you want the rule to affect.

If you want to instead only limit access to a specific bucket, you can select the **Resource ID** checkbox instead.  Provide the name of the bucket in the field - nothing else is necessary.  
{: tip}

## Create a network zone
{: #cos-tutorial-cbr-network}
{: step}

Now that we know what the rule will affect, we need to decide what the rule will allow. To do this, we'll create a new _network zone_ and apply it to the new rule.  

1. Click on **Create +**.

![Scope the rule](images/cbr_5.png)

2. Give the network zone a helpful name and description.
3. Add some IP ranges to the **Allowed IP addresses** text box.
4. Click **Next**.

![Scope the rule](images/cbr_6.png)

## Finish the rule and verify that it works
{: #cos-tutorial-cbr-network}
{: step}

Finally, all you need to do is click **Create** and your new rule will be active.  

An easy way to check that it works is to [send a simple CLI command] from outside of the allowed network zone, such as a bucket listing (`ic cos buckets`).  It will fail with a `403` error code.
