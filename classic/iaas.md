# Transitioning from COS IaaS



Bluemix infrastructure offerings are connected to a three-tiered network, segmenting public, private, and management traffic. Infrastructure on a customer's Bluemix account may transfer data between one another across the private network at no cost. Infrastructure offerings (such as bare metal servers, virtual servers, and file/block storage) connect to other applications and services in the Bluemix catalog (such as Watson services, containers, runtimes) across the public network, so data transfer between those two types of offerings is  metered and charged at standard public network bandwidth rates.
