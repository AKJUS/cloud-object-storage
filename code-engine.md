# Using {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}}
{: #code-engine}

[{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-getting-started) is a fully managed, serverless platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, micro-services, event-driven functions, or batch jobs. {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} even builds container images for you from your source code. All these workloads can seamlessly work together because they are all hosted within the same Kubernetes infrastructure. The {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} experience is designed so that you can focus on writing code and not on the infrastructure that is needed to host it.  {: shortdesc}
