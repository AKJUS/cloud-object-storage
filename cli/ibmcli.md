# Use the IBM Cloud CLI

There is a beta version of a {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} plugin [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Platform CLI](https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html) available for anyone interested in trying it out.  Note that this plug-in is beta software and subject to change, and is not suitable for production workloads.

## Installation and Configuration

The plugin can be installed using the `plugin install` command.

```
ibmcloud plugin install cos
```

Configure the plugin with `ibmcloud cos config`.  This will populate your credentials or repopulate them if your _~/.bluemix/config.json_ file has reset. 

You can also configure the program to use Amazon HMAC credentials to log into your account. To generate HMAC credentials, you can add the `{"HMAC":true}` parameter when generating a [service credential](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/hmac/credentials.html). Then you can run `ibmcloud cos config --hmac` to input your HMAC credentials into the program (please note that you must switch priority to HMAC credentials using `ibmcloud cos config --switch` after inputing HMAC credentials). If you choose to use IAM authentication (the standard IBM way to authenticate), you do not need to provide any credentials â€“ the program will authenticate you automatically.

At any time, to switch between HMAC and IAM authentication, you can type `ibmcloud cos config --switch [iam | hmac]`. For more information on IAM-based authentication, click [here](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/iam/quickstart.html#getstarted).

The program also offers the ability for you to set the default location where files will be downloaded (by default, this is set to the user's Downloads folder), and to set a default region where the program will look for and create buckets in. To set the default download location, type `ibmcloud cos config --dl` and input into the program a valid download file path. To set a default region, type `ibmcloud cos config --region` and provide a input into the program a region code, such as `us-south`. By default, this value is set to `us-geo`.


  After a period of inactivity, the credentials under ~/.bluemix/config.json will reset.
  Re-login to IBM Cloud using `ibmcloud login` to repopulate the necessary credentials to use with the plugin.

## Supported Commands

Each operation listed below has an explanaton of what it does, how it's supposed to be used, what parameters are necessary, and a technical explanation of how it works. Unless specified as optional, all parameters listed under "Parameters to provide" are required. For an explanation of the `credentials.json` file, refer to the "`credentials.json` Guide" below.

The IBM Cloud CLI mandates that commands start with `ibmcloud`. However, until the "Bluemix" brand is phased out, you can also start commands by `bx` and `bluemix`. So, you can do `ibmcloud cos`, `bluemix cos`, or `bx cos` to start a command.

### Create a New Bucket
* **Action:** Create a new bucket in an IBM Cloud Object Storage account.
* **Usage:** `ibmcloud cos create-bucket --bucket [BUCKET_NAME] [--region REGION_NAME] [--class CLASS_TYPE]`
* **Parameters to provide:**
    * The name of the new bucket.
    * _Optional_: The region where the bucket will be created. If this parameter is not provided, the program will use the `DefaultRegion` value in the `credentials.json` file located in the user's `.bluemix` folder.
       * Flag: `--region REGION_NAME`
    * _Optional_: The class of the bucket. If this parameter is not provided, the program will create a bucket of class Standard.
	   * Flag: `--class CLASS_TYPE`


### Delete an Existing Bucket
* **Action:** Delete an existing bucket in an IBM Cloud Object Storage account.
* **Usage:** `ibmcloud cos delete-bucket --bucket [BUCKET_NAME] [--region REGION_NAME]`
* **Parameters to provide:**
    * The name of the bucket to be deleted.
    * _Optional_: The region where the bucket is located. If this parameter is not provided, the program will use the `DefaultRegion` value in the `credentials.json` file located in the user's `.bluemix` folder.
       * Flag: `--region REGION_NAME`


### Get a Bucket's Location
* **Action:** Determine the location and class of a bucket in an IBM Cloud Object Storage account.

* **Usage:** `ibmcloud cos head-bucket --bucket [BUCKET_NAME] [--region REGION_NAME]`
* **Parameters to provide:**
	* The name of the bucket to get the details.
	* _Optional_: The region where the bucket is located. If this parameter is not provided, the program will use the `DefaultRegion` value in the `credentials.json` file located in the user's `.bluemix` folder. The AWS SDK requires the region of the bucket to successfully determine if it exists.

## Manually controlling multipart uploads 
The IBM Cloud Object Storage CLI provides the ability for users to upload large files in multiple parts using the AWS multipart upload functionality. To initiate a new multipart upload, run the `multipart-upload-create` command, which returns the new upload instance's upload ID. In order to continue with the upload process, you must save the upload ID for each subsequent command. This command requires you to generate an MD5 hash. Refer to the [Amazon documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-multipart-upload-cli/) for more information on how to generate an MD5 hash for a multipart upload instance.

Once you have run the `multipart-upload-complete` command, run `part-upload` for each file part you wish to upload. **Note that for multipart uploads, every file part (except for the last part) must be at least 5MB in size.** To split a file into separate parts, you can run `split` in a terminal window. For example, if you have a 13MB file named `TESTFILE` on your Desktop, and you would like to split it into file parts of 5MB each, you can run `split -b 3m ~/Desktop/TESTFILE part-file-`. The Terminal will generate 3 file parts â€“ two file parts of 5MB each, and one file part of 3MB, with the names `part-file-aa`, `part-file-ab`, and `part-file-ac`. For more information on this process, refer to the attached video in the [Amazon documentation.](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-multipart-upload-cli/)

As each file part is uploaded, the CLI will print out its ETag. You must save this ETag into an appropriately formatted JSON file, along with the part number. Below is an example of how the JSON file should be formatted. Use this template to create your own ETag JSON data file.

```
{
  "Parts": [
    {
      "PartNumber": 1,
      "ETag": "The ETag of the first file part goes here."
    },
    {
      "PartNumber": 2,
      "ETag": "The ETag of the second file part goes here."
    }
  ]
}
```

Add more entries to this JSON template as necessary.

To see the status of your multipart upload instance, you can always run the `part-list` command, providing the bucket name, key, and the upload ID. This will print out raw information about your multipart upload instance. Once you have completed uploading each part of the file, run the `multipart-upload-complete` command with the necessary parameters. If all goes well, you will receive a confirmation that the file uploaded successfully to the desired bucket.

### `credentials.json` Guide
The `credentials.json` file stores user preferences. The IBM Cloud Object Storage CLI reads and writes to this file periodically. Below is an example of a `credentials.json` file, and an explanation of each field:

```
{
    "CRN": "EXAMPLE_CRN",
    "Last Updated": "Wednesday, August 29 2018 at 11:11:38",
    "HMACProvided": "true",
    "DownloadLocation": "/Users/myusername/Downloads",
    "DefaultRegion": "eu-gb"
}
```

* The user's service instance ID (`CRN`)
* The last time the service instance ID was updated (`Last Updated`)
* The user's choice between HMAC and IAM authentication (`HMACProvided`)
* The user's default download location (`DownloadLocation`)
* The user's default region to look for and create buckets in (`DefaultRegion`)

This file is generated automatically by the `config` command and can be manually edited.
